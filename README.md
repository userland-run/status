# userland.run — status

The **single source of truth for the state of userland.run / NanoVM**: what
capabilities exist, what is tested, what is green or red, and where the gaps and
drift are. Live at **https://status.userland.run**.

> 📚 Project documentation: <https://userland.run/docs/>. See [Part of userland.run](#part-of-userlandrun).

It is a *hub*: a feature **registry** is joined against **test results** that each
producing repo's CI publishes, producing a unified matrix that is rendered as a
static dashboard and committed as [`STATUS.md`](./STATUS.md).

## Layout

| Path | What |
| ---- | ---- |
| `registry/`        | the source of truth: `areas.yaml` + `features/*.yaml` (immutable IDs) |
| `contract/`        | `results.schema.json` — the JSON every producer emits (`userland-results.json`) |
| `ingest/`          | `suites.yaml` (suite → layer), `schedules.yaml` (central cadence) |
| `data/incoming/`   | producers commit `<source>.<suite>.json` here; the push triggers regeneration |
| `generator/`       | TypeScript: load → validate → JOIN → derive drift → emit `data/state.json` + `STATUS.md` |
| `app/`             | Next.js static dashboard (Overview / Matrix / Gaps) |
| `test/`            | the hub's own test suite (registry / contract / join / drift / snapshots) |

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run generate     # join registry + data/incoming → data/state.json + STATUS.md
npm test             # registry / contract / join / drift / snapshot tests
npm run dev          # dashboard at http://localhost:3000
npm run build        # static export → out/
```

## How a feature becomes "green"

1. It exists in `registry/features/*.yaml` with an immutable `id`
   (`area.group.name`, e.g. `emulator.syscall.openat`).
2. A real test in some repo is tagged with that id (`@feat:<id>`).
3. That repo's CI emits `userland-results.json` and the `publish-results` action
   commits it to `data/incoming/`.
4. The generator joins it in; the cell turns green/red on the next build.

IDs are **immutable** — rename via `superseded_by:`, never by editing an id
(tests in other repos reference them).

## Part of userland.run

This is the monitoring hub for the **[userland.run](https://userland.run)** workspace; each repo
below is a results **producer** whose CI emits `userland-results.json`:

| Repo | What it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| [nano](https://github.com/userland-run/nano) | The RV64GC → WASM emulator core |
| [sdk](https://github.com/userland-run/sdk) | `@userland-run/nano-sdk` — typed TypeScript SDK |
| [terminal](https://github.com/userland-run/terminal) | `<nano-terminal>` web component |
| [catalog](https://github.com/userland-run/catalog) | Signed app marketplace |
| [website](https://github.com/userland-run/website) | Landing page + hosted docs at [userland.run/docs](https://userland.run/docs/) |
| **[status](https://github.com/userland-run/status)** | The status/conformance dashboard — **this repo** |
